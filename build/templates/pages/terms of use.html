      illegal, unenforceable or invalid, and the remaining parts of these Terms

    <h3>Your* rights at law</h3>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions give you* rights at law that can't be limited or

      If the WA Government is liable to you* under the Australian Competition
      and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or similar legislation, then (to the extent

      provisions to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>loss or corruption of data or damage to any technology;</li>
      <li>
        the payment of the cost of having Planning Online or relevant services
        supplied again,
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>as the WA Government chooses.</p>
